Decrementing In-Degrees of Connected Vertices:

Purpose:  When a vertex is removed from the graph (i.e., added to the topological sort order), all its outgoing edges are effectively removed as well.
          This means that the in-degrees of the vertices at the other ends of these edges must be decremented because one incoming edge to them has been removed.
Details:
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {     : This loop iterates through all vertices.
            if (arr[out[k]][i] == 1) {  : Here, out[k] is the vertex just removed from the graph. arr[out[k]][i] == 1 checks if there is an edge from out[k] to vertex i.
              in[i]--;                  : If there is an edge from out[k] to i, the in-degree of vertex i is decremented by 1, reflecting the removal of that edge.

Incrementing the Index for the Output Array:

Purpose:  The variable k keeps track of the position in the out array where the next vertex should be placed.
          After a vertex is added to the out array, k is incremented to point to the next empty position.
Details:
          k++;                          : This increments the k index to prepare for the next vertex to be placed in the topological sort order.
